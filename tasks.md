To integrate the `Project` model into your CRM project (replacing `Client` with `Customer`), hereâ€™s what needs to be updated or added based on your existing schema and the provided model:

1. Create `projects` table migration #
2. Create `statuses` table migration (for `Status` model) #
3. Create `milestones` table migration (for `Milestone` model)
4. Create `project_user` pivot table migration (for `members` relationship)
5. Create `timesheets` table migration (for `Timesheet` model)
6. Create `invoices` table migration (for `Invoice` model)
7. Create `files` table migration (for `File` model with polymorphic `fileable`)
8. Create `tickets` table migration (for `Ticket` model)
9. Create `notes` table migration (for `Note` model with polymorphic `noteable`)
10. Create `discussions` table migration (for `Discussion` model)
11. Create `activity_logs` table migration (for `ActivityLog` model with polymorphic `loggable`)
12. Create `contracts` table migration (for `Contract` model)
13. Create `sales` table migration (for `Sale` model)
14. Create `customer_feedback` table migration (for `CustomerFeedback` model)
15. Update `customers` table to ensure compatibility with `client_id` foreign key (already exists as `customers` table)
16. Update `tasks` table to add `project_id` foreign key (for `tasks` relationship)
17. Create `Status` model
18. Create `Milestone` model
19. Create `Timesheet` model
20. Create `Invoice` model
21. Create `File` model (with polymorphic support)
22. Create `Ticket` model
23. Create `Note` model (with polymorphic support)
24. Create `Discussion` model
25. Create `ActivityLog` model (with polymorphic support)
26. Create `Contract` model
27. Create `Sale` model
28. Create `CustomerFeedback` model
29. Update Filament resources for new models (e.g., `ProjectResource`, `StatusResource`, etc.)
30. Configure `bezhansalleh/filament-shield` permissions for new models/resources
31. Update `Customer` model to reflect `hasMany` relationship with `Project`
32. Ensure database relationships (foreign keys) are constrained properly
33. Update any existing Filament pages/panels to include `Project` and related resources
34. Validate Laravel 12 compatibility for new migrations and models
35. Update seeders/factories for new models (optional, for testing)- **Database Schema**: Add `projects` table with columns for `name`, `customer_id` (foreign key to `customers`), `description`, `start_date` (date), `deadline` (date), `budget` (decimal), `total_billed` (decimal), `created_by` (foreign key to `users`), `status_id` (foreign key to new `statuses` table), `billing_type` (string/enum), `hourly_rate` (decimal), `is_visible_to_client` (boolean), `allow_client_comments` (boolean), plus timestamps and soft deletes; remove or ignore `custom_fields` json column if using pivot table approach like existing custom fields.

- **New Tables**: Create `statuses` table with `id`, `name`, `color` (optional), `position` (integer), timestamps.

- **Pivot Table**: Add `project_user` table for many-to-many relationship between projects and users, with optional `role` column.

- **New Models**: Generate `Status` model with fillable `name`, `color`, `position`; add relationships if needed (e.g., hasMany `projects`).

- **Additional Models for Relationships** (if not integrating with existing): `Milestone`, `Timesheet`, `Invoice`, `Ticket`, `Note` (polymorphic), `Discussion`, `ActivityLog` (polymorphic), `Contract`, `Sale`, `CustomerFeedback`; update `Task` model to include `project_id` foreign key and relationship; create `File` model for polymorphic uploads.

- **Model Updates**:
  - `Project`: Update `client()` to `customer()` with `belongsTo(Customer::class, 'customer_id')`; adjust other relationships to use existing tables where possible (e.g., reuse `tasks` with `project_id`, `documents` as files via polymorphic).
  - `Customer`: Add `hasMany` for `projects`.
  - `User`: Add `belongsToMany` for `projects` via `project_user`; update `tasks` if assigning to projects.
  - `Task`: Add `project_id` foreign key and `belongsTo(Project::class)` optional relationship.

- **Filament Resources**: Create `ProjectResource` with form fields for all fillable attributes, table columns including relations (customer name, status name), actions for view/edit/delete; integrate relations like `HasManyTasks`, `BelongsToCustomer`; add inline widgets for tasks, milestones, etc.

- **Filament Shield Permissions**: Run `php artisan shield:install` if not done, then generate permissions for `projects` resource (view, create, update, delete, etc.); assign to roles like super_admin; customize for related resources (e.g., `tasks.view_project`).

- **Custom Fields Integration**: If keeping `custom_fields` json, no change; else, update `custom_fields` and `custom_field_customers` to support `projects` via new foreign key or polymorphic (add `table_type` column).

- **File Uploads**: Configure Filament file upload for `files()` polymorphic, ensuring storage link and validation.

- **Notifications**: Ensure mail configuration for `Notifiable` trait (e.g., project status changes).

- **Seeding/Migrations**: Create migration for all new tables/pivots, seed initial statuses (e.g., 'In Progress', 'Completed'); update existing task migration if adding project_id retroactively.

- **Potential Conflicts**: Review `tasks` table (add nullable `project_id`); ensure no clashes with existing `customer_pipeline_stages` or `quotes` for project billing.
